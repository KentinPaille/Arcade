We need to create two games using three different graphics libraries and be able to change games or graphics libraries dynamically. When the graphics library is changed, the game data must be exported to the new graphics library.

The graphics libraries chosen are:
- Ncurse
- SFML
- Sdl2
- Raylib (bonus)

The games chosen are:
- Snake
- Nibler

Utilisation

```
$> make
$> ./arcade ./lib/arcade_library_name.so
```

Exemple: ./arcade ./lib/arcade_ncurses.so
